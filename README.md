# Design-Patterns
Notes/examples from my study of design patterns

## Preface
To understand the importance and the pros/cons of each design pattern, I think that it is also important to include a section of notes about SOLID design principles, because at times, design patterns compromise one of the SOLID design principles, in-order to more strictly enforce another SOLID deisign principle. 

I plan to takes notes on several important design patterns from a wide varitey of resources. Studies materials will be added in the "Resources" sections as necessary. 

## SOLID

### Single Responsibility Principle

> Each component should be responsible for a single part or functionality of the system

> Each Git commit should be pertain to a single task or user-story

### Open-Close Principle

> Software components should be open for extension, but closed for modification

### Liskov Substitution Principle

> Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the system

### Interface Segregation Principle

> No client should be forced to depend on methods that it does not use/need

### Dependency Inversion Principle

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions

> TODO: add more here

## Types of Design Patterns
   1) Creational
      > These patterns are deisgned for calss instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.
   2) Structural
      > Designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition
   3) Behavioral
      > Designed depending on how one class communicates with others

## Strategy
   * About utilizing composition rather than inheritance
   * "Defines a family of algorithms encapsulated each one and makes them interchangeable"
   * With only inheritance, it is not feasible to share behavior with neighboring nodes in a inheritance tree with inheritance, however, using the Strategy Pattern, behavior is abstracted out and allows for the sharing of behavior between neighboring nodes in an inheritance tree

## Decorator
   * Great for adding functionality to an object at runtime
   * Flexible alternative to sub-classing
   * Provides flexibility by allowing the program to mix/match/repeat the layering of decorators

## Observer
   * Is about moving from a poll architecture to a push architecture
   * Instead of having the observer ask the observable if it has changed, we have the observable tell the observer that it has changed
   * Polling is when the observer(s) are responsible for asking if the observeable has changed its state
      * this can present several issues like: how often should we check for changes, when should we start checking for changes, when should we stop checking for changes
   * Pushing is when the observable is responsible for telling the observer(s) when it has changed

## Factory Method
   * Unlike Strategy where you have to construct the new object, the factory method abstracts away the construction of new objects at runtime
   * Abstracts away complex object generations
   * Is about polymorphism
   * Abstracts the business logic needed to create some kind of object
   * You have the things you are trying to create and the things that create them (Factories)
   * Lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses/concrete-factories
   * Good for when you donâ€™t necessarily know how you want to construct an object, why you want to construct that object, and what parameters you want to pass when constructing that object

## Abstract Factory
   * TODO

## Singleton
   * Insures that a class only has one instance and provides a global access to that single instance
   * You make the constructor static private so that you can't construct the class outside of that class
   * You then make a static variable that holds the class object that is shared throughtout your program
   * Common arguments against Singleton pattern
      * Having to make the Singleton global makes it somewhat unpredictable. It could change without you indenting to. Whenever you leak to the global namespace, it could change without you knowing
      * You are making the assumption that you will only EVER need one instace of a class
      * Makes your code less flexible if you decide that you do not want your class to be a Singleton anymore
      * Diffficult testing
      * One man's constant is another man's variable 

## Command
   * Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different request, queue, or log requests and support undoable operations
   * We can take a bunch of the encapsulated commands and we can use the commands and pass them around to give some kind of context
   * You can make a list of commands and invoke them one at a time
   * Helpful for things like undo/redo stacks
   * You have a ICommand interface that specifies that each class implementing this interface must specify a void method for how it executes and unexecutes (undo)
   * Concrete Commands implement the exeute and unexecute methods, and have a specified Receiver. The command's exeute method will typically call one of the receiver's methods, or directly change one of it's values
   * You have an Invoker class, who maintains 0 to many ICommand(s)
