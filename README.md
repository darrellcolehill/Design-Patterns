# Design-Patterns
Notes/examples from my study of design patterns

## SOLID

## Strategy
   * About utilizing composition rather than inheritance
   * "Defines a family of algorithms encapsulated each one and makes them interchangeable"
   * With only inheritance, it is not feasible to share behavior with neighboring nodes in a inheritance tree with inheritance, however, using the Strategy Pattern, behavior is abstracted out and allows for the sharing of behavior between neighboring nodes in an inheritance tree

## Decorator
   * Great for adding functionality to an object at runtime
   * Flexible alternative to sub-classing
   * Provides flexibility by allowing the program to mix/match/repeat the layering of decorators

## Observer
